The interventions evaluated can be drugs, devices (e.g., hearing aid), surgeries, behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking cessation program), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions). We consider clinical trials experiments because the investigators rather than the patients or their doctors select the treatment the patients receive. Results from randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of evidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials incorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of treatments are objective and unbiased. The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are shown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US.\nThe course will explain the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several common designs used for clinical trials, such as parallel and cross-over designs. We will also explain some of the mechanics of clinical trials, like randomization and blinding of treatment.

Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. It is used by most major technology companies, and is assumed knowledge for many modern programming and IT jobs.  It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud-native computing. You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing. \n\nIn this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently \"know just enough Git to be dangerous\". \n\nThere are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)\n\nYou can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux. \n\nThis course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub). \n\nThis course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 5-10 hours to go through one of the two paths, but your mileage may vary.","difficulty_level":"","duration":"Approx. 12 hours to complete","keywords":"Version Control, Github, Bitbucket, Command-Line Interface, ","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/version-control-with-git"},{"title":"Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python","description":"In this course, learners will be introduced to the field of statistics, including where data come from, study design, data management, and exploring and visualizing data.

This is not a course on quantum mechanics. We will gently touch it in the beginning and then leave it apart, concentrating on the mathematical model of quantum computer, generously developed for us by physicists. This doesn't mean that the whole course is mathematics either (however there will be enough of it). We will build a simple working quantum computer with our bare hands, and we will consider some algorithms, designed for bigger quantum computers which are not yet developed. \n\nThe course material is designed for those computer scientists, engineers and programmers who believe, that there's something else than just HLL programming, that will move our computing power further into infinity.\n\nSince the course is introductory, the only prerequisites are complex numbers and linear algebra.

Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.\n\nData science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as \"data science in action\".\n\nThe course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.\n\nThis course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.\n\nThe course covers the three main types of process mining.\n\n1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.\n\n2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.\n\n3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.\n\nProcess mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\" and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.\n\nThe course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.\n\nAfter taking this course you should:\n- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining),\n- understand the role of Big Data in today\u2019s society,\n- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification,\n- be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks),\n- have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project,\n- be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data,\n- explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and\n- be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner.","difficulty_level":"Intermediate Level","duration":"Approx. 30 hours to complete","keywords":"Petri Net, Process Modeling, Process Mining, Data Mining, ","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/process-mining"},{"title":"Marketing Digital","description":"Aprenda a desenvolver a estrat\u00e9gia de marketing digital para a sua empresa ou startup, nesse curso voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 aprender sobre os principais pontos do Marketing como ROI, SEO, SEM, Testes AB e como gerenciar o funil de convers\u00e3o e tamb\u00e9m como usar plataformas como Google adwords e Analytics, Facebook Ads e Email Marketing.\nEsse curso \u00e9 ministrado por profissionais do mercado que v\u00e3o apresentar como aplicar cada um dos conceitos com aulas te\u00f3ricas e pr\u00e1ticas.\n\nNeste curso ser\u00e3o abordados os seguintes temas:\nDiferen\u00e7a entre o marketing tradicional\nImport\u00e2ncia do ROI e como calcular\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o a funil\nGoogle Analytics\nGoogle Adwords \nTipos de canais\nComo funciona SEM\nComo funciona SEO\nComo funciona Facebook Ads\nComo funciona Email Marketing\nConfigurando e planejando campanhas\nTestes AB\nComo escolher sua estrat\u00e9gia\nMetrifica\u00e7\u00e3o e itera\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nAo final desse curso, esperamos que voc\u00ea esteja familiarizado com os principais conceitos, ferramentas e metodologias do marketing digital.\n\nN\u00e3o deixe de ver as perguntas frequentes antes de se inscrever\n\nConhe\u00e7a os nossos outros cursos:\n- Cria\u00e7\u00e3o de Startups: Como desenvolver neg\u00f3cios inovadores\n       https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/criacao-startups  \n- UX \/ UI: Fundamentos para o design de interface\n       https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/ux-ui-design-de-interface \n- Consolidando empresas: Estrutura jur\u00eddica e financeira\n       https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/consolidando-empresas\n- Inove na gest\u00e3o de equipes e neg\u00f3cios: o crescimento da empresa\n       https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/gestao-equipes-negocios \n- Marketing e vendas B2B: fechando novos neg\u00f3cios\n       https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/marketing-vendas-b2b","difficulty_level":"Beginner Level","duration":"Approx. 13 hours to complete","keywords":"Digital Marketing, Marketing Analytics, Google Adwords, Google Analytics, Marketing Performance Measurement And Management, ","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/estrategia-marketing-digital"},{"title":"Sequences, Time Series and Prediction","description":"If you are a software developer who wants to build scalable AI-powered algorithms, you need to understand how to use the tools to build them.

With this course, recorded on campus at UCSD, we seek to share our access to top people in the field who bring an unprecedented range of expertise on drug commercialization.\n\nThis course will cover pharmacoeconomic, marketing strategy, intellectual property strategy, portfolio management, managed markets and strategic alliances. It will also have a lecture case study from startup to success.\n\nIn addition, the course will discuss post-marketing clinical trials or Phase 4 trials. These are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environ\u00adment using a much larger group  of patients.  This enables new treat\u00adment uses for the new drug to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made, and determination  of the clinical  effectiveness of the new drug in  a wider variety of  patient types, and  more rare side effects, if any, may be detected .\n\nPre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market's needs are incorporated into the new drug's overall develop\u00adment. Later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in  order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug. In addition to the marketing strategy, pricing strategy and a tactical plan will be developed. Promotional material, and the sales force will be trained so that when the product is approved they can promote the drug to physician, pharmacist and nurses.  \n\nThis course is intended as part 3 of a series: Drug Discovery (https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/drug-discovery), Drug Development (https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/drug-development) and Drug Commercialization.

The goal here is give you a roadmap and framework for how financial professional make decisions.  \n\nWe will cover the basics of financial valuation, the time value of money, compounding returns, and discounting the future.  You will understand discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation and how it compares to other methods.  We also step inside the mind of a corporate financial manager and develop the basic tools of capital budgeting.  We will survey the how, when, and where to spend money, make tradeoffs about investment, growth, dividends, and how to ensure sound fiscal discipline.  Our journey then turns to a Wall Street or capital markets perspective of investments as we discuss the fundamental tradeoff between risk and return.  We then synthesize our discussion of risk with our valuation framework and incorporate it into series of direct applications to practice.\n\nThis course requires no prior familiarity with finance.  Rather, it is intended to be a first step for anyone who is curious about understanding stock markets, valuation, or corporate finance.  We will walk through all of the tools and quantitative analysis together and develop a guide for understanding the seemingly complex decisions that finance professionals make.  \n\nBy the end of the course, you will develop an understanding of the major conceptual levers that push and pull on financial decision making and how they relate to other areas of business.

It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and ordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly mean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by whom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us?\n\nThese are just a handful of questions that will be addressed in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. \n\nThe second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies. Since \u20189\/11\u2019 terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to debunk them as myths. \n\nThe final part looks into the implications and possibilities for policy making.

Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy \u2013 M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!\n\nWe will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firm\u2019s long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.\n\nOur treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?\n\nThe tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.\n\n* Who is this class for?\nWe hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience.

The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.\n\nThree features of the new system are central.\n\nMost important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  \n\nSecond, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. \n\nThird, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.","difficulty_level":"","duration":"Approx. 44 hours to complete","keywords":"","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/money-banking"},{"title":"Troubles du spectre de l'autisme : diagnostic","description":"Qu\u2019est-ce que l\u2019autisme ?\nComment reconna\u00eetre l\u2019autisme ?\nPeut-on observer des signes d\u2019autisme chez les b\u00e9b\u00e9s ? \n\nCes questions vous interpellent ?

This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.\n\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\n\nTraditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. \n\nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\n\nIn the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.\n\nSuggested Readings\nThe course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course. \nFor students interested in additional study material, you may refer to:\n\u2022\tGatti Stefano, \"Project Finance in theory and practice\", Academic Press, 2nd edition, 2012.","difficulty_level":"","duration":"Approx. 18 hours to complete","keywords":"Capital Budgeting, Risk Analysis, Project, Finance, ","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/infrastructure-investing"},{"title":"Sample-based Learning Methods","description":"In this course, you will learn about several algorithms that can learn near optimal policies based on trial and error interaction with the environment---learning from the agent\u2019s own experience.

nature, cyber conflicts are an international issue that span across nation-state borders. By the end of the course, you will be able to apply the knowledge gained for analysis and management of international cyber incidents and conflicts including for activities such as development of policy related to cybercrime and cyberwarfare. Management of cyber incidents and conflicts requires an interdisciplinary perspective including an understanding of: 1) characteristics of the cyber threats and conflicts themselves, 2) international efforts to reduce and improve cyber security, and 3) psychological and sociopolitical factors. \n\nThe course is designed to reach an international audience and will encourage discussion on relevant current events among participants to enrich the experience with various personal and cultural perspectives on cutting-edge issues. In addition, assignments and other assessments will supplement video lectures and selected readings to ensure application of the material.\n\n\nAfter taking this course you will be able to:\n\n\u2022 Identify different types of actors involved in cyber threats (individuals, organizations & nation-states)\n\u2022 Distinguish between different types of threats and issues in cyber security including, data theft, political espionage, critical infrastructure protection, and propaganda\n\u2022 Detail the basic characteristics of the Internet infrastructure and international efforts to address Internet governance\n\u2022 List several international efforts to address cyber crime and espionage\n\u2022 Evaluate how principals that govern international conflicts might be applied in context of cyber security\n\u2022 Apply different psychological theories of human motivation and cooperation and communication and political theories in analysis of different international issues related to cyber security including censorship, media operations and role of social technologies.\n\n\nGrading:\n\nYour grade is assessed based on discussion posts and quizzes. Individual taking this course for credit (i.e. students at the University at Albany y will be required to engage in additional activities communicated to them directly). \n\n\nRecommended Background:\n\nNo background knowledge or skills are necessary, but an understanding and familiarity of cyber security, Internet infrastructure and international law would be advantageous for anyone who participates in the course.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nErsin Dincelli and Nic DePaula were the instructional designers for the course who assisted in the recording of the videos, reviewing material, creating slides, assessments and some of the content. Without their tremendous effort this would not have been possible. We also acknowledge the financial support for the recordings from the University at Albany as well as the support from Media and Marketing. Finally, thanks to Lisa Stephens who is the SUNY liaison to Coursera for being a strong supporter of the MOOC.","difficulty_level":"","duration":"Approx. 9 hours to complete","keywords":"Cybersecurity, Cybercrime, Cyberwarfare, Internet Protocol (IP) Suite, ","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/cyber-conflicts"},{"title":"Ordered Data Structures","description":"In this course, you will learn new data structures for efficiently storing and retrieving data that is structured in an ordered sequence.

deserve our allegiance, and when should they be denied it? \n\nThis course explores the main answers that have been given to this question in the modern West. We start with a survey of the major political theories of the Enlightenment: Utilitarianism, Marxism, and the social contract tradition. In each case, we begin with a look at classical formulations, locating them in historical context, but then shift to the contemporary debates as they relate to politics today.\n\nNext, we turn to the rejection of Enlightenment political thinking, again exploring both classical and contemporary formulations. The last part of the course deals with the nature of, and justifications for, democratic politics, and their relations to Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment political thinking.\n\nIn addition to exploring theoretical differences among the various authors discussed, considerable attention is devoted to the practical implications of their competing arguments. To this end, we discuss a variety of concrete problems, including debates about economic inequality, affirmative action and the distribution of health care, the limits of state power in the regulation of speech and religion, and difficulties raised by the emerging threat of global environmental decay.","difficulty_level":"","duration":"Approx. 23 hours to complete","keywords":"","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/moral-politics"},{"title":"Auditing I: Conceptual Foundations of Auditing","description":"This course provides an intensive conceptual and applied introduction to auditing in society.

However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.\n\nBut what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?\n\nThis course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning \u2013 transformative, 21st century learning:\n\n1. Ubiquitous Learning\n2. Active Knowledge Making\n3. Multimodal Meaning\n4. Recursive Feedback\n5. Collaborative Intelligence\n6. Metacognition\n7. Differentiated Learning\n\nThese affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, demonstrate these affordances in action.\n\n--------------------------------\nRecommended Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\" including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nTake this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions.

You'll then have a solid grounding to move on to more sophisticated analysis and take the other courses in the series. You'll learn the popular, flexible and completely free software R, used by statistics and machine learning practitioners everywhere. It's hands-on, so you'll first learn about how to phrase a testable hypothesis via examples of medical research as reported by the media. Then you'll work through a data set on fruit and vegetable eating habits: data that are realistically messy, because that's what public health data sets are like in reality. There will be mini-quizzes with feedback along the way to check your understanding.

The first course covered generalities on the international courts and tribunals in The Hague, while the second course provided an insider's  perspective into the work of international criminal courts and tribunals.  This third course explores the major aspects of international arbitration as one of the most common method of international dispute settlement . Through this course you will gain an in-depth understanding of the  various facets of international arbitration through the analysis of its role as a mechanism of dispute settlement, its institutions, the fields of law it is applicable to, and, of course, its most famous awards. \n\nThe main question we will answer together during this course is \"Can international arbitration contribute to the creation of a peaceful world through the settlement of disputes between States and between States and non-State actors?\" In order to do so, we will learn the basic historical concepts or arbitration, as well as everything there is to know about the Permanent Court of Arbitration, based in The Hague. We will then dive into the role of international arbitration in settling disputes relating to the Law of the Sea, with a particular insight into the landmark South China Sea Arbitration. For an entire module, we will focus on investment arbitration, its principles and the procedure of the ICSID, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. We will conclude the course with a module on the interplay between state immunity and enforcement of arbitral awards. This is brought to light through the Yukos Arbitration which is a perfect illustration of the topic.\n\nThis course offers you an opportunity to gain a better insight into international arbitration, its role and the current issues relating to it. You will gain in-depth knowledge of the principles and rules of arbitration. You will explore the topic through concrete examples and the most prominent arbitrations. You will also grasp the notion of international arbitration navigating between law and politics. International arbitration and The Hague go hand in hand: several key arbitration institutes are located in The Hague and important disputes were settled here through arbitration. The Hague is, so to speak, \u2018the place to be for international arbitration\u2019, especially when we are dealing with arbitration between States, or arbitration of investment disputes between foreign investors and States. \n\nJoin us for the course and become an expert on international arbitration!\n\nThis course is free to join and to participate in.

We place cities in the context of sustainable urban transformation and climate change. Sustainable urban transformation refers to structural transformation processes \u2013 multi-dimensional and radical change \u2013 that can effectively direct urban development towards ambitious sustainability and climate goals.\n\nWe will connect the key trends of urbanization, decarbonisation and sustainability. We will examine visions, experiments and innovations in urban areas. We will look at practices (what is happening in cities at present) and opportunities (what are the possibilities for cities going forwards into the future). We bring together a collection of diverse short films and key short readings on sustainable cities as well as interactive forums and a practical assignment to create an online learning community.\n\nThis course provides key examples of activities to promote sustainable cities in Scandinavia, Europe and around the world. We utilize films and reports by WWF, the Economist Intelligence Unit, ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability, UN-Habitat, C40 Climate Leadership Group, Arup, Sustainia, the Rockefeller Foundation, and ongoing research projects. This course is produced by Lund University in cooperation with WWF and ICLEI. It is available for free to everyone, everywhere!\n\nThe International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) at Lund University is an international centre of excellence on sustainable solutions. The IIIEE is ideally suited to understand and explain the interdisciplinary issues in sustainable cities and greening the economy utilising the diverse disciplinary backgrounds of its international staff.

Problems in public health and health policy tend to be complex with many actors, institutions and risk factors involved. If an outcome depends on many interacting and adaptive parts and actors the outcome cannot be analyzed or predicted with traditional statistical methods. Systems  thinking is a core skill in public health and helps health policymakers build programs and policies that are aware of and prepared for unintended consequences.\n\nAn important part of systems thinking is the practice to integrate multiple perspectives and synthesize them into a framework or model that can describe and predict the various ways in which a system might react to policy change. Systems thinking and systems models devise strategies to account for real world complexities.\n\n\nThis work was coordinated by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, the World Health Organization, with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.

The very idea that individuals can be taught to lead is not without its skeptics. Reasonable people, even some scholars in the field, point to the important traits, skills, and attributes that are observed in many visible leaders and contend that certain qualities necessary for effective leadership are not easily transmitted. To accept this premise and conclude that some people are born as natural leaders and others cannot be expected to lead at all is to make a mistake at the other end of the logical spectrum. We believe that leadership can be taught as long as it is concurrently nurtured, that most people possess a constellation of strengths around which they can construct their own leadership philosophy and approach, and that leadership development programming\u2014if done well\u2014can be transformative for organizers and participants.\n\nCourse Level Objectives:\nUnderstand the historical narrative of institutions as well as institutional structures that have created instances of inclusion and exclusion in colleges and universities. \nDescribe how transformational leadership is enacted for diversity, equity, and inclusion in a complex and contested environment.\nCompare legislative, governance, and public accountability and expectations in relation to contemporary issues in higher education.\nAnalyze the strategic diversity planning process and documents of a selected institution. \nRecommend innovations and opportunities for transformational change at various levels of the ecological model using the strategic diversity planning process as a tool.","difficulty_level":"Intermediate Level","duration":"Approx. 14 hours to complete","keywords":"","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/leading-for-equity-diversity-inclusion"},{"title":"International Leadership and Organizational Behavior","description":"Leaders in business and non-profit organizations increasingly work across national borders and in multi-cultural environments. You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team, or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context. \n\nIn this course \u2013 together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi alumni \u2013 we\u2019ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts \u2013 enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.\n\nLearning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?\n\nIf you really want to learn how organizations behave and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this is the course for you.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and discovery. \n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\nWeek 1 - Leadership Acumen. International perspective on leadership, common traps & challenges, and opportunities of intercultural leadership. \nWeek 2 - Navigating Culture. Impact of cultural differences on organizations, decoding culture, culture classifications and stereotyping, developing intercultural intelligence. \nWeek 3 - Communication.

What\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the \u201cfourth dimension\u201d? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can\u2019t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime?

The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language \u201cfits together\u201d to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.\n\nThis course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.\n\nThe course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.\n\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.\n\nWeek 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.","difficulty_level":"Intermediate Level","duration":"Approx. 36 hours to complete","keywords":"Recursion, Higher-Order Function, Pattern Matching, Functional Programming, ","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/programming-languages"},{"title":"Introduction to Cyber Attacks","description":"This course provides learners with a baseline understanding of common cyber security threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.

A core curriculum is supplemented by lectures that contextualize the content with specific examples and programs from around the world. The core curriculum introduces learners to a global perspective on gender based violence (GBV), and includes a review with Dr. Claudia Garcia-Moreno of the new WHO guidelines on responding to violence. Students who wish to receive Honors Recognition will complete the honors module, which expands on the core material and highlights special circumstances and programs. \n\nThis is an in-depth course with 2 components: \n1) Core curriculum introduces GBV from a global perspective, with an emphasis on ensuring a strong health sector response to GBV and teaching key competencies for social workers, physicians, nurses, midwives, community health workers, counselors, and other healthcare workers. Completion of the core content is required for students to pass the course. \n2) Honors curriculum offered by experts from around the world helps students dive deeper into certain issues, and touches on unique populations and specialized topics. Completion of Honors curriculum is required for those students who wish to receive a Certificate of Accomplishment with Honors.\n\nAfter taking the course, students will be able to:\n\u25cf\tDescribe the global epidemiology of leading forms of GBV and the evidence linking GBV to poor health.\n\u25cf\tArticulate the challenges, strategies, and WHO guidelines for integrating GBV response within the health sector. \n\u25cf\tDescribe the components of a comprehensive clinical assessment, treatment, and management of a GBV survivor.\n\u25cf\tDescribe the appropriate psychosocial support and management of a GBV survivor.\n\nModule 1 \u2013 Introduction to GBV- Epidemiology and Health Impact\nGBV comes in a variety of forms, each with health consequences for the survivor. An understanding of these issues helps inform a comprehensive and multi-sectorial response for preventing and responding to GBV. \n\nModule 2 \u2013 Health Care Response, Screening, and Psychosocial Support\nRecognition of health impacts of GBV has led to calls to address GBV within the health sector. Support for GBV survivors extends beyond clinical exam and assessment. Safety planning, harm reduction, and access to psychosocial support must be ensured. \n\nModule 3 \u2013 Clinical Care for GBV Survivors\nCaring for GBV survivors requires compassionate, confidential, and nondiscriminatory clinical assessment. Competent medical and forensic examination, along with appropriate documentation, is essential.\n\nHonors Module \u2013 In-Depth Information and Special Topics\nThis module provides additional materials for those who wish to explore specialized topics and gain a more advanced grasp of the complexities of addressing gender-based violence. Core course topics are expanded upon, and special populations and programs are highlighted. Special topics include violence in humanitarian settings, against adolescents and sex workers, and human trafficking. Further information is provided on epidemiology, policy, and ethical guidelines, as well as the use of mHealth in GBV screening and care. We\u2019ll cover the unique challenges of GBV research, and explore programs that encourage men and boys to be engaged in the prevention of violence against women. \n\nAcknowledgments\nThis course is a project of the Johns Hopkins Center for Clinical Global Health Education.

Neuroscience, when allied with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why we make decisions. Neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making, decisions under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course. You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.\n\nThe course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials. The course provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings of  Neuroeconomics. Our students have different backgrounds; therefore, I have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand the interdisciplinary content. This course will help you to start your progress in the field of Neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other more advanced courses and trainings in the future.

Shocked by economic assumptions of human behavior as self-centered and focusing only on what can be measured? Asking yourself if there are no sensible economic alternatives to free markets? Then you are at the right place to learn economics! \n\nThis is the first online course that teaches economics from a pluralist perspective. Economic pluralism means that a plurality of theoretical and methodological viewpoints is regarded as valuable in itself and is simply the best way in which economics can make progress in understanding the world. This MOOC will illustrate economic pluralism not only in substance but also in form. You will see not only me, a Professor of Economics, but also a pop-up Prof of our business school, who illustrates the actor perspective of firms, government and civil society. And you will meet an online student, based in Greece, who will help you through the tutorial videos in which I will explain key concepts, tools and techniques. \n\nI will not limit myself to the dominant theory, as almost every other course does. Instead, I will introduce you to four very different economic theories for the whole set of standard topics in microeconomics and macroeconomics. The theories are presented every time from broad and more interdisciplinary to narrow and more mathematical. The four theories that I like to introduce you to are Social Economics, Institutional Economics, Post Keynesian economics and, at the very end of each topic, Neoclassical Economics, for the special case of ideally functioning markets. But not everything is different in this course. Like every economics course, it includes numbers, diagrams, tables, equations, and some calculations. \n\nWhy would you go through the effort of learning the basics of four theories instead of one? Because it will help you to see why many economists cannot predict crises, whereas others can see signals but are often not being listened to because they do not belong to the dominant school of thought. It will also enable you to see that it is just one theory claiming economic agents to be self-centered and focusing on the measurable only. Other economic theories go well beyond these limitations. And, finally, the pluralist approach will provide you with policy alternatives to neoliberalist policies promoting free markets. \n\nThe objective of this course is twofold. First, to enable you to understand different economic viewpoints, linked to important traditions in economic thought, and basic economic concepts belonging to these theoretical perspectives. Second, to enable you to do some basic economic calculations that are important in economic life, such as calculating an inflation rate, and in economic policies, such as estimating the rough gains from trade for both trading partners, and in economic arguments, such as in calculating utility maximization with given prices and budgets.\n\nI hope you will enjoy the

It discusses the many changes that occur in people\u2019s lives when they are uprooted by a disaster, including many important topics related to humanitarian crises, such as when there is an epidemic a public health emergency; what do we mean with the humanitarian development nexus; what are the basics of disaster epidemiology and surveillance; humanitarian principles; and other very relevant topics. We will explore what humanitarian interventions could look like if we want to mitigate the effects of disasters. \n\nThis course is a follow-up to Public Health in Humanitarian Crises 1, which dealt with changes in disease patterns, access to health care, livelihoods, shelter, sanitary conditions, nutritional status, and other issues. \n\nThe course content is a mix of theoretical knowledge and many practical examples from recent disasters. We think this course is unique because it contains so many practical \u2018real-life\u2019 examples and is taught be instructors and guest lecturers who together have over 200 years of experience in this field. The course consists of 10 modules totaling approximately 14-16 hours of delivered content with an additional 2-3 hours of self-work (quizzes and writing and evaluating a short peer-review assignment) as well as lively discussions forums. The first course, Public Health in Humanitarian Crises 1 (PHHC1), has been designed in a way that each module builds on the lessons of previous modules. However, the modules from this second course, Public Health in Humanitarian Crises 2 (PHHC2) can be accessed in any order and some can stand alone. You do not necessarily need to do PHHC1 before PHHC2, but it might be helpful to take some or all of PHHC1, as some of the basic or fundamental issues are covered in this course. PHHC2 contains a somewhat more diverse set of topics than the previous course as it deals with more complicated issues.\n\nYou do not have to pay for this course if you choose to enroll without a certificate.

Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.\n    \nKnowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. \n\nWe will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. \n    \nOnce recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. \n\nAfter editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board\u2014a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n    \nIn the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience.

Business is about making money. Sustainability is about protecting the planet. Business is measured in months and quarters. Sustainability often requires significant short term costs to secure a sometimes uncertain long-term benefit. To some activists, all executives are exploitative, selfish one percenters. To some executives, all activists are irresponsible, unyielding extremists. \n\nAnd yet engaging with the issue isn\u2019t optional \u2013 all businesses must have a strategy to deal with sustainability and, like any strategy, this involves making choices. \n\nThis Strategy and Sustainability course based on Rosenberg's recently published book by Palgrave (http:\/\/www.palgrave.com\/la\/book\/9781137501738) that encourages learners to filter out the noise and make those choices in a hard-nosed and clear-eyed way. Prof. Rosenberg\u2019s nuanced and fact-based point of view recognizes the complexity of the issues at hand and the strategic choices businesses must make. He blends the work of some of the leading academic thinkers in the field with practical examples from a variety of business sectors and geographies and offers a framework with which senior management might engage with the topic, not (just) to save the planet but to fulfill their short, medium and long-term responsibilities to shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThis course promises to be both engaging and thought-provoking, aimed at anyone who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of a subject that is no longer perceived as a choice but a necessity for future managers and business leaders alike.","difficulty_level":"Beginner Level","duration":"Approx. 16 hours to complete","keywords":"","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/strategy-sustainability"},{"title":"Global Trends for Business and Society","description":"In this course, you\u2019ll learn to analyze rapidly changing global trends, their effects on consumer and labor markets, financial systems, and geopolitical relationships among countries all over the world.

It will challenge you to move outside of your existing comfort zone and to recognize the value of that exploration.  This course will help you understand the importance of diverse ideas, and to convey that understanding to others. \n\nThe principal learning activity in the course is a series of \"differents\" where you are challenged to identify and change your own cultural, habitual, and normal patterns of behavior. Beginning with a prompt, e.g. \"eat something different\", you will begin to recognize your own = limits and to overcome them. In addition, you are encouraged to understand that creativity is based on societal norms, and that by it's nature, it will differ from and be discouraged by society. In this course, the persistence of the creative person is developed through practice. At the same time, these exercises are constrained by concerns of safety, legality, and economics, which are addressed in their creative process.","difficulty_level":"","duration":"Approx. 14 hours to complete","keywords":"","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/creative-problem-solving"},{"title":"An Introduction to Global Health","description":"This course will provide you with an overview of the most important health challenges facing the world today.

Led by DeVos Institute Chairman Michael M. Kaiser and President Brett Egan, this course will introduce you to a management theory called the Cycle which supports thriving arts and cultural organizations. Learning from our work with managers from over 80 countries around the world, the DeVos Institute developed the Cycle as a simple, but powerful tool to assist managers in their effort to respond to an increasingly complex environment and propel their institutions to excellence. \n\nThe Cycle explains how great art and strong marketing can create a family of supporters, who in turn help the organization produce the revenue required to support even more great art the next year. The Institute has seen the Cycle work in performing and presenting organizations, as well as museums, arts schools, and other nonprofit endeavors like service organizations, historical societies, public libraries, university programs, advocacy organizations, botanical gardens, and zoos.\n\nBy taking this course, you will learn: \n\n\u2022 the importance of bold, exciting, and mission-driven programming in an organization; \n\u2022 how long-term artistic planning can help an organization produce this work; \n\u2022 how an organization can aggressively market that programming and the institution behind it to develop a family of supporters - including ticket buyers, board members, donors, trustees and volunteers; \n\u2022 how an organization can cultivate and steward this family to build a healthy base of earned and contributed income; and \n\u2022 how an organization can reinvest that income into increasingly ambitious programming year after year.\n\nAll course material is available upon enrollment for self-paced learners.

Following the first one which introduces our subject, the modules 2 (nuclear physics)\nand 3 (accelerators and detectors) are rather self contained and can be studied separately. The modules 4 to 6 go into more depth about matter and forces as described by the standard model of particle physics. Module 7 deals with our ways to search for new phenomena. And the last module introduces you to two mysterious components of the Universe, namely Dark Matter and Dark Energy.","difficulty_level":"","duration":"Approx. 31 hours to complete","keywords":"","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/particle-physics"},{"title":"University Teaching","description":"University Teaching is an introductory course in teaching and learning in tertiary education, designed by staff at the Centre for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning at the University of Hong Kong.  \n\nWith input from instructors, guests and interviewees, including teaching award winners, students, and experts in the fields, you will be exposed to research evidence in relation to effective university teaching and practical instructional design strategies.

comprehensive understanding of all aspects of dairy management such as genetics, nutrition, reproduction, animal health, farm economics, and sustainability of dairy production systems. There's something here for everyone whether you are just looking for the basics or have years of experience in the dairy industry.\n\nThis is an eight-week course. Each week consists of four to nine video lectures, additional reading materials, and a multiple-choice questions quiz. Estimated study time is between three and five hours per week. Learners have the option to purchase a Course Certificate for 49.00 USD. The certificate can be purchased at any time, but you must verify your identify before taking the course quizzes in order to be eligible. For those who cannot afford the certificate fee, financial aid is available through Coursera.\n\nWhy is producing milk efficiently and sustainably so important? \n\nMilk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients, such as: Energy, Protein and Essential Amino acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, several B vitamins, including B12, Pantothenic and Folic acids, and essential minerals such as Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, as well as other minerals. Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his\/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?\n\nMost milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.\n\nIn this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.\n\nCourse lectures are translated into Portuguese and Chinese; PDF files of these translations can be found under each course week. The Dairy MOOC team thanks Dr. Antonio Branco (Universidade Estadual de Maring\u00e1, Brazil) and Ms. Yuanyuan Zhang (Pennsylvania State University) for translating the lecture materials.\n\nCourse Sponsors\n\nThis course was supported by the generous contributions of Innovation Center for US Dairy at Silver Level and Pancosma North America, RP Nutrients, Inc. and Arm and Hammer, which provided funding support at a Bronze Level.

You must learn to overhaul your relationship with failure, which is a valuable source of experience and should be managed according to the logic of \u201cacceptable loss\u201d: the entrepreneur loves uncertainty, not excessive risk. The creation of tech businesses gives you a genuine opportunity to change the world, but requires you to adopt a particular state of mind and to be able to acquire knowledge, know-how and interpersonal skills.\n\nYou will have the chance to work alongside passionate and exciting people from a whole multitude of backgrounds. From a technological point of view, these women and men have constructed numerous companies of a global scale.\n\nThe development trajectory of a tech business is full of mishaps which require you to be both agile and greatly prepared to build on a strong idea, choose your market, develop your proposal, assemble a team worthy of the task in hand, and finding financing.\n\nThe course is made up of methodological sessions as well as first-hand accounts from entrepreneurs and people who have succeeded in creating tech businesses themselves. You will thus be able to get to know the essential dilemmas with which high-tech business creators are confronted with, beginning with the initial decision to set up your very own structure, which itself represents a significant life decision.\n\nYou will also see that the creation of a tech business is much more a collective adventure than an individual one.\n\nIn the English version, all of the reading content, quizzes and assesments will be in English, whilst the videos will have French audio and English subtitles.","difficulty_level":"","duration":"Approx. 18 hours to complete","keywords":"Business Plan, Business Model, Innovation, Entrepreneurship, ","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/tech-startup"},{"title":"A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment","description":"What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?\n\nThis is surely one of life\u2019s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nUntil recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka \"Dr. Happy-smarts\") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. \n\nAlthough not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. \n\nFor Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com. Please mention that you are a student of the \"coursera happiness course\" in your email. \n\nThe course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:\n      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),\n      - Ed Diener (\u201cDr. Happiness\u201d),\n      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),\n\nBy taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:\n      - Why aren\u2019t the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they could\u2014or should\u2014be\n      - What are the \u201c7 Deadly Happiness Sins\u201d that even the smart and the successful commit?, and\n      - What are the \u201c7 Habits of the Highly Happy\u201d and how can you implement them in your life?\n\nBy the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.","difficulty_level":"","duration":"Approx. 33 hours to complete","keywords":"Gratitude, Mindfulness, Happiness, Meditation, ","url":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/happiness"}]
